I am a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Information Security at the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.csu.edu.cn/), Central South University. My research interests include computer vision, deep learning, and medical image processing. During my undergraduate studies, I have actively explored cutting-edge AI technologies and participated in several related projects.

I had an internship at the [School of Vehicle and Mobility](https://www.svm.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Tsinghua University, where I focused on applying computer vision and deep learning to intelligent transportation. This experience provided me with valuable hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of the field.

Currently, I am seeking research opportunities to further enhance my academic skills and prepare for my future graduate studies.ðŸ˜Ž
