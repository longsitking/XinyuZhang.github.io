Hey there! 👋 I'm a third-year undergraduate student majoring in **Information Security** at the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.csu.edu.cn/), **Central South University**. I'm passionate about **computer vision, deep learning, and medical image processing**—basically, teaching computers to “see” and make sense of the world. 🧐💡  

During my undergrad years, I’ve dived deep into AI, tinkered with models, and tackled some exciting projects. I also had the opportunity to intern at the [School of Vehicle and Mobility](https://www.svm.tsinghua.edu.cn/), **Tsinghua University**, where I applied **computer vision and deep learning** to **intelligent transportation**. 🚗💨 It was an eye-opening experience (pun intended 😉) that sharpened my research skills and expanded my horizons.  

Right now, I’m on the lookout for **exciting research opportunities** to level up my academic game 🎯 and gear up for my future graduate studies. If you're working on something cool, let's connect! 😎
